1. I had to use 
pip install cryptography --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" --global-option="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
borrowed from here: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/3489 to install cryptography on macos

2. I had to change the version of PyYAML to 3.13 in the requirements because of this:
https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/126
https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/152
